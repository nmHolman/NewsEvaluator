# Text Evaluator

This project accepts text (copy/pasted from news articles, blogs, books, reviews, etc.) and returns a sentiment analysis (using the MeaningCloud API) of that text to determine the Subjectivity, overall sentiment agreement, and the Polarity of each sentence. More about sentiment analysis can be found in [MeaningCloud's Documentation](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis/doc/2.1/what-is-sentiment-analysis).

The aim of this project was to become more familiar with:

* Webpack set-up & use
* Webpack loaders & plugins
* Service workers
* Using APIs
* Using Sass
